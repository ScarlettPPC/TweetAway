# TweetAway
 A third-party Twitter client written in Python
 By ScarlettPPC 2024

Get your Twitter cookie using an extension called "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY", available on Firefox and Chrome:
1. Install extension
2. Navigate to twitter.com
3. Export as JSON

Next put the file in the root directory of the Twitter client and run cookieconvert.py
It should create a new file called cookie.json.

Next open a terminal and execute run.sh
If everything is done correctly it should start up correctly and when navigating to localhost:8000, should open the main page!
